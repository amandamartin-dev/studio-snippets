This is the code used on the DevStudioCon website to create the typewrite animation seen below the marquee header.

This code requires advanced knowledge of design on Wix Studio to recreate the proper layers to make this animation responsive and accessible. 

See the [DevStudioCon website](https://www.devstudiocon.com/) for a live example of this code.

For more information about how this site was made, see the [recap of the webinar](https://youtu.be/ZrbklkxIJrM) hosted in the [Devs On Wix community](https://discord.gg/devs-on-wix)
